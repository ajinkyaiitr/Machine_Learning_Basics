Linear Regression can be basically of basically of univariate linear regression or multi variate linear regression
It covers the operations done on matrices
----Basics of Vectors and Matrices
Vectors are actually shapes of matrices which we write in the form of rows and columns
Columns represents the dimensions of a vector, and rows represents matrix

Vector Space:
Collection of all the possible Vectors
Unit Vector:
1)Vector of magnitude[Length of a Vector] 1 and 90 degree with another vector
Denotation:
A = X + Y
A = a * i + b * j
***Any vector from a vector space can be represented in terms of linear combination of unit vector of its vector space
Addition of two vectors by scaling up or scaling down

Dot Product using projection of vectors:
If x = (a,b)
|x| = âˆša2 + b2

Linear Transformation:
